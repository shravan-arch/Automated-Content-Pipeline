# Abstract

The exponential growth of digital information has made it increasingly difficult for users to efficiently extract meaningful insights from large textual documents. Academic papers, technical reports, and professional documents often span thousands of words, requiring significant time and effort to review manually.

The Relevance Agent is an AI-powered document summarization system designed to address this challenge. It utilizes Google Gemini to generate concise and relevant summaries while maintaining scalability and quota safety. The system introduces an importance-based summarization strategy that dynamically adjusts summary depth based on the relevance of document sections. This approach improves summary quality without increasing computational or API costs.

The project demonstrates practical applications of natural language processing, responsible use of generative AI, and scalable system design suitable for academic evaluation and real-world usage.
