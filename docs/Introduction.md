# Introduction and Problem Statement

In the modern digital era, individuals are frequently required to process large volumes of textual data. Students analyze research papers, professionals review reports, and researchers study extensive documentation. Manually reading and summarizing such documents is time-consuming and inefficient.

While automated summarization tools exist, many struggle with large inputs due to token limitations and excessive resource usage. Additionally, conventional summarizers often treat all document sections equally, resulting in summaries that fail to emphasize key concepts.

The Relevance Agent addresses these problems by introducing a hierarchical and importance-aware summarization system. By intelligently prioritizing critical content and managing large inputs through chunk-based processing, the system provides meaningful summaries while remaining efficient and scalable.
